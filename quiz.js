            "description": "You are finding out that life is really busy on a space station!  As the newest member of ‘Dare: Explorers of the Universe’ you’ve been here at space camp for just three ‘earth’ days, but time has gone by really quickly.  It feels like a lifetime has passed since your science project won you a place on the team, and it has been non-stop ever since. \n\nYou strap on your zero gravity boots, wondering what today’s training mission will be.  At that moment The Astronaut’s voice comes on over the loud speaker, asking you to meet her on the Moon Deck.\n\nToday is the day you have been waiting for!  Using your bed as a launch pad, and the door frame to guide you, you float out the door to meet her, smiling to yourself as you go.  ",
            "question": "An astronaut floats in the air when they are in space – why do you think that is?",
            "answer1": "Because of gravity.",
            "response1": "Yay! You got the first question right.  ",
            "answer2": "It’s just more fun that way",
            "response2": "It is more fun, but that isn’t the answer. Try again!",
            "answer3": "There isn’t much room, so astronauts float to make it easier to get around.",
            "response3": "Good guess, but that’s not right. Try again.",

            "heading": "Moon Base",
            "description": "Yay! You got the first question right.\n\nDid you know that the Space Stations have to travel super-fast to stay in Earth’s orbit?  And even though it looks like you’re floating, you are actually falling?  Because you are travelling at the same speed as you’re falling - just like the moment your body lifts off the seat when you’re riding a rollercoaster. It just looks and feels like floating!\n\nWhen you get to the Moon Deck, you take a minute to look around.  How exciting to know that you are one of the lucky few who has ever seen the moon up close.  It is even more exciting to think about the chance to finally earn your Dare: Space Explorers’ badge!\n\nThe Astronaut calls your name and explains what you will be doing.\n\n“Your mission today is to travel to each of the planets and out into deep space, testing your knowledge of the universe as you go.  We will be waiting for you when you get back,” she adds, opening the door to your own personal spacecraft.  “The Dare Team members are already out there.  They are expecting you, and will help you on your way.  Take care out there, Dare Explorer!” she says.\nYou take a deep breath and strap yourself in, wondering what you will find.  Could you be the first person to discover alien life in outer space?\n",
            "question": "People think there may have been life on Mars at some point – why do they think this?",
            "answer1": "Because they have found evidence of water on Mars.",
            "response1": "Yes, that’s right!",
            "answer2": "Because they’ve seen too many movies!",
            "response2": "All the movies with Martians did help give people this idea, but there’s a more scientific reason. Give it another go.",
            "answer3": "Because Mars is close to Earth. ",
            "response3": "Good go, but not quite. Try again! ",

            "description": "Yes, that’s right!  You are still wondering about alien life when you land your ship inside the crater of a dusty volcano on the surface of Mars.  As you kneel down to catch a tiny water droplet in your test tube, you start to feel as if you’re being watched…  you also notice a strange rumbling that feels like it’s heading your way.  Taking a deep breath, you turn around and come face-to-face with a huge metal object, with blinking lights and strange-looking probes for hands. \n\n“I see you’ve met my friend Rover,” laughs a voice.  You are still trying to work out where the voice is coming from and keeping a watchful eye on the strange object, when The Adventurer steps forward to shake your hand.  “Well done, Dare Explorer!” he says.  “Sorry if we scared you.” \n\nYou breathe a sigh of relief, suddenly grateful to be looking at a Mars Rover and the friendly face of The Adventurer, and not an alien! He begins to tell you all about the new galaxy highway, ‘The Mars Bar Express’.  \n“Answer my question and I’ll be happy to point you there,” he says with a smile.  You quickly agree, pretty sure all that work on your winning science project will come in handy.",
            "question": "What is the Great Red Spot on Jupiter?",
            "answer1": "A huge storm that has raged for at least 350 years.",
            "response1": "“Yes, that’s right! ",
            "answer2": "A massive ocean filled with red seaweed.",
            "response2": "There’s no ocean and no seaweed on Jupiter. Try again!",
            "answer3": "A giant pimple.",
            "response3": "That would be gross! But it’s not the right answer, try again!",
