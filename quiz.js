As the newest member of ‘Dare: Explorers of the Universe’, there's always a new challenge and time has gone by really quickly.  It feels like a lifetime has passed since your science project won you a place on the team, and you've been busy ever since. \n\nYou wake up early in the morning and strap on your zero gravity boots, wondering what today’s training mission is.",

Using your bed as a launch pad, and the door frame to guide you, you float out the door to meet her, smiling to yourself as you go. \n\n“Hello new cadet!“ says The Astronaut as you arrive in the room. “This is the main deck of our moon base and it's named after the Maori word for the moon - 'Marama'. Before you start today's mission, I have a question for you:“ ",

As you walk through the base, she explains the challenge that lays ahead.\n\n“Your mission today is to travel to each of the planets and out into deep space, testing your knowledge of the universe as you go. The Dare Team members are already out there.  They are expecting you, and will help you on your way.  Take care out there, Dare Explorer!“ \n\n She opens the space hatch and guides you inside. You take a deep breath and strap yourself in, wondering what you will find.  Could you be the first person to discover alien life in outer space?",
            "question": "People think there may have been life on Mars at some point – why do they think this?",

As you walk out onto the surface, yuo notice a strange rumbling that feels like it’s heading your way.  Taking a deep breath, you turn around and come face-to-face with a huge metal object, with blinking lights and strange-looking probes for hands. \n\n“I see you’ve met my friend Rover,” laughs a voice.  You are still trying to work out where the voice is coming from and keeping a watchful eye on the strange object, when The Adventurer steps forward to shake your hand. “Sorry if we scared you.” \n\nYou breathe a sigh of relief, suddenly grateful to be looking at a Mars Rover and the friendly face of The Adventurer, and not an alien! He begins to tell you all about the new galaxy highway, ‘The Mars Bar Express’. “Answer my question and I’ll be happy to point you there.”",

The storm is so big that three Earths could fit into it,” nods The Adventurer. “It’s the storm that makes travelling on the Mars Bar Express so quick.”  Strapping yourself back into your spacecraft, you prepare for what you expect will be a rocky landing.\n\n A strange mist that looks a little like melted chocolate and caramel, swirls by your windscreen as you are tossed and tumbled about.  You quickly snap a photo on your mobile phone, before putting your head down to brace for landing, just like you were taught in training.  Once the spaceship has landed, you wait for the gas to clear and step down onto a surface that looks and feels like just like a slushy! \n\n   “Welcome to Europa, one of the biggest of Jupiter’s 67 moons,” says The Time Traveller, hovering above you. “Europa is mostly covered in water and ice, but we're safer here than in the heat and storms on Jupiter! Jump on my spaceboard and, if you can answer this question, I’ll give you a ride!”",

Zooming off at high speed, you just manage to grab hold of his pack and tighten the strap on your helmet as you zip around all nine rings of Saturn, dodging ice and scooping up a bright red rock particle as you go. \n\n You come to a hovering stop above the gassy surface of Uranus.  Waving up at you is The Inventor, her lab coat pockets full of test tubes and bottles.  The Time Traveller drops you off, shouting a quick “Later, dudes!” before disappearing into the distance. \n\n “You’ve made it all the way to Uranus,” says the Inventor. “You did a great job, zipping in and out of all of those moons so fast!”",

Once you are both safely inside, The Inventor helps you into a methane-powered jet pack. She promises to fuel you up ready for the next part of your journey… but first you must answer her question. \n\n “Lots of the planets are named after the gods and goddesses from old Greek and Roman myths and legends.

As you get closer, you notice a glowing figure in the distance, waving to get your attention. \n\n “Welcome to the farthest planet from the sun!” calls The Wizard, as an icy wind whips and whirls at his words.  All around you, space dust twinkles magically, like glitter in the wind. \n\n You quickly take the top off the bottle of methane and use it to scoop up some dust particles before they're whisked away.  The gas changes from green to purple, before bubbling mysteriously and finally settling to a yellow glow.  “That’s weird,” you think, as you tuck it into the pocket of your spacesuit for safe keeping. The Wizard raises his wand to prepare you for your next destination.",

Not quite sure if that was science or magic, you glide on through the darkness, noticing the slow moving dust and particle clouds that form the Milky Way… And who should you spot whipping around the spiral edges, but The Challenger himself! \n\n As you get closer, he skids to a stop and calls out a friendly greeting.  “Glad you made it!  Been expecting you,” he calls.  You float to a stop beside him, peering behind him into the darkness. \n\n “Is that a Black Hole?” you ask.  “Sure is!” replies The Challenger. ",
            "question": "Do you know how a black hole is formed?",

You suddenly find yourself feeling grateful for the strange golden bubbles still attached to your spacesuit, lighting the way ahead. \n\n  “Some scientists think the universe was created by a Big Bang,” The Challenger explains.",
