          <p>You are finding out that life is really busy on a space station!  As the newest member of ‘Dare: Explorers of the Universe’ you’ve been here at space camp for just three ‘earth’ days, but time has gone by really quickly.  It feels like a lifetime has passed since your science project won you a place on the team, and it has been non-stop ever since.</p> 
          <p>You strap on your zero gravity boots, wondering what today’s training mission will be.  At that moment The Astronaut’s voice comes on over the loud speaker, asking you to meet her on the Moon Deck.</p>
          <p>Today is the day you have been waiting for!  Using your bed as a launch pad, and the door frame to guide you, you float out the door to meet her, smiling to yourself as you go. </p>
